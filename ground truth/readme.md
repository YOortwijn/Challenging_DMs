# Quine conceptual network ground truth

The expert constructed ground truth consists of a concentual network of terms in which terms from the index of Quine's Word & Object are categorized as part of one of five clusters (*language*, *ontology*, *reality*, *mind*, *meta-linguistic*) or as a relational term (i.e. part of either the *reference* or *regimentation* relation that connects (parts) of clusters to each other). The resulting ground truth can be found in this folder in a few different formats to allow for easy viewing and easy machine reading. Here a short explanation of the categories will be given with an example of a term clustered in it for each.

## Clusters
The clusters consist of terms such that two terms in the same cluster are conceptually related by their shared relation to the hypernym (e.g. *noun* and *verb* are conceptually related since they are both linguistic items and are therefore both in the *language* cluster). So the terms that are clustered together are semantically similar to each other. 

### Language
The language cluster consists of terms that stand for elements of language that refer to ones ontology. An example is *singular term* which are expressions that refer to or designate individual objects. 

### Ontology
The ontology cluster consists of term that stand for objects as they are refered to. To understand this, consider the following quote: "My tentative ontology includes physical objects , in a generous sense . The content of any portion of space-time , however scattered , is for me a physical object . In addition my ontology includes , as I said , the abstract hierarchy of classes based on those objects ." So the ontology consists of both physical and abstract objects. Note that this is separate from reality, as we have no way of refering to reality without the mediation of our ontology. 

### Reality
The reality cluster consists of terms that stand for elements of our sensory stimuli. Aside from *stimulus*, an example of a term in this cluster is *phoneme*, since it is an element in the auditory expression of words. The rationale behind clustering *phoneme* as *language* instead of *language* is that *phoneme* constitutes the way words (language) cause sensory stimuli, so it is indeed related to language but not semantically similar to the elements of *language*.

### Mind
The mind cluster consists of terms related to the conceptual scheme through which we conceptualise. Consider the following quote: "The individual acquires the system mainly in the process of learning the language itself , and likewise the development of our basic conceptual scheme down the ages is bound up with the evolution of the language ." 

### Meta-Linguistic
The meta-linguistic cluster consists of terms related to the more technical aspects of language. An example of a term in this cluster is *conditional* which is primarily discussed in the context of the truth-function of logical statements. 

## Relational terms
Opposed to the clusters, the relational terms are are related terms that are not necessarily semantically similar. The idea behind these is that these are two important subjects in Quine's work, so while the terms are not semantically similar they are closely related to each other in the specific context of Quine's work. 

### Reference
This is the relation between elements of language and elements of ontology, e.g., a *singular term* refers to a *physical object*. 

### Regimentation
Regimentation is the process through which one can uncover the ontological commitment of a theory, that is, the uncovering of what objects exist according to a theory. This combines parts of the *language* and *meta-linguistic* cluster to uncover what objects are indispensible in reference and what can be paraphrased away.
